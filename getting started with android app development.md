# Android App Development
This article aims to provide beginner-level resources to people trying their hands on Android Development for the first time.
Android apps are primarily written in Java, XML and now Kotlin(sometimes C++ too), but you'll only need Java and XML to get started. If you're not familiar with one or both of these languages, it is recommended that you get a basic understanding before diving in. You might want to quickly brush through the following articles to gain some level of insight into these languages:
* Java [w3school](https://www.w3schools.in/java-tutorial/)
* XML [w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/)
